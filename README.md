# Sumo Fight

**Sumo Fight** is an exciting platform fighting game where you control sumo wrestlers. The goal is to knock your opponents off the platforms and be the last one standing. But beware! If someone jumps on your head, you'll be stunned for a moment, and your movements will be temporarily blocked.
